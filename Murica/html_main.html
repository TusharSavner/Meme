                    Here’s an unrelated fact: once upon a time, the U.S. actually had a $10,000 bill. 
                    Yes, ten thousand in a single note. It was banned in 1969 because the government decided 
                    criminals shouldn’t be able to carry my entire net worth folded neatly in a shirt pocket. 
                    Instead, they wanted them to carry a suitcase — boosting suitcase sales and creating jobs 
                    so workers could have the freedom to buy food. 
                    Anyways — haha, pain.

                 You probably don’t know this, but there’s a tragic epidemic in the world right now: unemployed people with Computer Science degrees. <br>
And the worst part? Instead of curing cancer or inventing flying cars, we spend our days stealing Wi‑Fi from the neighbor’s router named “TP‑Link_420”, just so we can build ugly little websites on decade‑old laptops that sound like jet engines when they open Chrome.<br>

These sites? Oh, they’re masterpieces of garbage. Default blue buttons straight out of 2002. Fonts so bad they make Comic Sans look classy. Content? Nonexistent — unless you count making fun of powerful countries as a career move. <br>

We write paragraphs that are too long, too stupid, and so pointless that even ChatGPT would reply with: “Bro, I got nothing.” <br>
And yet… here you are. Reading this train wreck of a page. So I guess the joke’s on you.

                <h2>I NEED HELP!!!!!!</h2>
    <p>
    I know, I know — asking strangers on the internet for money is the oldest scam in the book.  
    You’ve probably seen dozens of pop‑ups, donation pleas, and teary‑eyed videos telling you why  
    someone you’ve never met deserves a piece of your wallet.  
    That’s exactly why I didn’t start this page that way.  
    I didn’t want you to click away in the first five seconds thinking,  
    “Oh great, another pity party.” Instead, I tried to make you laugh.  
    I wanted you to read the jokes, click the dumb buttons,  
    roll your eyes at the satire, and maybe even mutter,  
    “Okay, that was kinda funny.”  
    Because if I could make you laugh even once — just once —  
    maybe, deep down, you’d feel I had earned the price of a coffee,  
    or even just a single dollar.  
</p>

<p>
    The truth is, I never wanted to write this part.  
    I argued with myself over and over:  
    “Don’t beg. Don’t make it weird. Keep it light, keep it funny.”  
    But life has a way of forcing you into corners you don’t want to be in.  
    When you’re desperate, pride becomes a luxury you simply can’t afford.  
    My younger sibling has been fighting a rare disease for years now,  
    the kind of battle that makes every day feel like a coin toss  
    between hope and heartbreak.  
    The hospital bills don’t just add up — they tower.  
    They come faster than I can pay,  
    like waves crashing before you’ve caught your breath from the last one.  
    And each envelope feels heavier than the one before.  
    So I distract myself with jokes —  
    about freedom, politics, and unemployed CSE majors —  
    because it’s easier to laugh at the absurd  
    than admit I cry myself to sleep wondering  
    how I’ll manage tomorrow.  
</p>

<p>
    So, here I am. Not a comedian. Not a web developer.  
    Not some influencer with millions of followers ready to share a GoFundMe link.  
    Just a scared human being on the internet,  
    sitting behind an old laptop that sounds like it’s preparing for liftoff  
    every time I open Chrome.  
    I don’t want to guilt you — I just want you to know I’m trying.  
    Even a single dollar could make a real difference in my sibling’s treatment.  
    Even a click means that someone out there saw me,  
    that I wasn’t just screaming into the void.  
    I’m not asking for a miracle.  
    I’m not expecting anyone to swoop in and save everything.  
    I’m only asking for a little faith, a little kindness —  
    the kind you’d give a stranger on the street if you knew their story  
    but never their name.  
</p>

<p>
    Please — if you laughed at my jokes,  
    if you smirked at even one dumb line,  
    or if you simply stayed on this site longer than you expected to,  
    consider this my one and only serious request here.  
    I don’t want to remember this page as a joke.  
    I want to remember it as the day a stranger cared enough to help.  
</p>

<p>
    Below is a button. Click it if you want to help.  
    I’ll be forever grateful.  
    Maybe someday, when things are better,  
    I’ll come back and rewrite this whole site  
    not as a cry for help, but as a thank‑you note  
    to the people who cared when it mattered most.  
    Until then, all I can offer you is my humor,  
    my honesty, and this little piece of my story.
